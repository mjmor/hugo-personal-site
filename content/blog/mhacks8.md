Today marks the second day of the 8th MHacks held by the University of Michigan. *Woooo Go Blue!* This year, the hackathon is held at the Masonic Temple in Detroit. It's a **very** suitable venue for the event. Extremely large. Ample areas to sleep in... if anyone gets any sleep.  


I came into this hackathon without having a project planned. I still don't have a project planned. In fact, I've resorted to finishing up old projects that I started and never completed. One of which is this website I'm currently blogging from. I used a wonderful static website generator called Hugo. Credit to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and its creator Steve Francia. It really is a great tool. So great in fact that I'm going to talk about how much I enjoyed using it in my next post!


But for now, I'm back to the hackathon!
